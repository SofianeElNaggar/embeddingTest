# Side Iteration

This directory contains initial exploratory tests conducted on **BERT** and **GPT-2**. These tests were performed as preliminary steps before focusing on the BART model. 

## Contents

### 1. BERT

- **Description**: Initial tests were conducted using BERT, as it is a widely-used model. However, these tests were not fully developed or completed because the model did not fully meet our specific needs and requirements.
- **Details**: The experiments performed with BERT serve as an initial exploration of how this model handles embeddings, but they were limited in scope and were eventually deprioritized in favor of other models.

### 2. GPT-2

- **Description**: Additional tests were conducted on GPT-2. These tests were very preliminary and were not extensively pursued because BART better suited our use case.
- **Details**: The experiments with GPT-2 were minimal and mostly exploratory. They provided some insights but were not developed into a comprehensive analysis.

## Overview

The tests in this directory were carried out in a more exploratory manner compared to the main focus on BART. While these experiments were useful for understanding the capabilities and limitations of BERT and GPT-2, the main emphasis of the project shifted towards BART, which aligned better with our requirements.

The content of this directory serves primarily as documentation of the initial approaches and directions considered before settling on BART as the model of choice.
