# Embedding Test

Welcome to this repository. This project is primarily focused on exploring and testing the embeddings of the **BART** model through various scripts, data, and experiments. Additionally, you will find a secondary folder containing initial tests conducted on **BERT** and **GPT-2**.

This repository is organized into two main folders:

### 1. Bart

This folder is the core of the project and contains:

+ **Data:** Datasets used to evaluate and test the performance of BART embeddings.
+ **Code:** Scripts that implement various experiments and analyses on BART embeddings.
+ **Results:** Outputs from the different experiments, most of them are not very relevant.

The purpose of this folder is to deeply explore how BART's embeddings work in various contexts and scenarios.

### 2. Side Iteration

This folder contains our initial, more exploratory tests conducted on **BERT** and **GPT-2**.

+ These experiments were carried out in a more naive manner and were never fully completed.
+ The contents of this folder serve more as documentation of what has been explored rather than a practical resource.

While this folder is not essential for users primarily interested in BART, it may provide insights into the approaches tested and the directions considered.

## Environment

This project is developed and tested in a virtual environment to ensure consistency and isolation of dependencies. Specifically, the following setup is used:

+ **Transformers Library Version:** 4.42.3
